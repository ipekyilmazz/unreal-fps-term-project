# unreal-fps-term-project
This is the first time I have used Unreal Engine with Blueprints to create a game project for my Master's degree term project. It's a first-person shooter with simple mechanics.

What did I add?

- Selected Arena Shooter Template as a base to customize.
- Implemented a new scene (UndergroundSciFi_Demo) and a new enemy NPC model.
- Changed the default gun model to a laser gun.
- Changed the bullet material and shooting sound.
- Enemy health bar as a world canvas showing their health
- Reload mechanic (with animation) implemented with R button (manual and auto).
- Shooting is blocked while reloading.
- Player health increase mechanic inside a healing zone
- Enemy AI spawner
